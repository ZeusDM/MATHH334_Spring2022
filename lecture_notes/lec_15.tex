\subsection{Closer look into Characters}

\begin{defn}{Isomorphic Representations}{}
	Two representations are isomorphic if they differ only by a change of basis.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}{Characters and Isomorphisms}{}
	Let \(G\) be a finite group. Then:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Two representations \(\rho_1, \rho_2\) of \(G\) are isomorphic if, and only if, \(\chi_1 = \chi_2\).
		\item The number of non-isomorphic irreducibe representations of \(G\) equals the number of conjugacy classes of \(G\).
	\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
